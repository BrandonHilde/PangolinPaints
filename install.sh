# Installs Pangolin Paints for this user, apart from this development folder: builds it here, copies the program to
# ~/.local/opt/pangolin/PangolinPaints, and adds it to the application list with its icon.
# The installed copy keeps its own settings, workspaces and macros, next to the program, so it never shares them with
# this folder's build. Run this again to update it (it can be running). ./install.sh --uninstall takes away the program,
# its menu entry and its icons, and leaves its settings, workspaces and macros in that folder.
# ./install.sh --no-build installs without building, for a copy made for another account (see below).
